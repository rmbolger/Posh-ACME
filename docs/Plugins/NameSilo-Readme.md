# How To Use the NameSilo DNS Plugin

This plugin works against the [NameSilo](https://www.namesilo.com) domain registrar. It is assumed that you have already setup an account and created the DNS zone(s) you will be working against.

## Setup

For authentication against the NameSilo API, an API key is required. Open the [api manager](https://www.namesilo.com/account/api-manager) page to generate the key. Read the note and understand that you can only retrieve the generated key once. If you have previously generated a key, use that one, otherwise by generating a new key you will invalidate the old key. Accept the API terms of use and click generate. Save the generated key in a secure location.

## Using the Plugin

You will need to provide the API key as a SecureString value to `NameSiloKey` or a standard string value to `NameSiloKeyInsecure`. The SecureString version can only be used from Windows or any OS running PowerShell 6.2 or later.

Note that NameSilo only updates DNS records every 15 minutes. So you should also provide a `-DnsSleep` parameter of 900 or more.

### Windows or PS 6.2+

```powershell
$key = Read-Host "NameSilo Key" -AsSecureString
$pArgs = @{ NameSiloKey = $key }
New-PACertificate example.com -Plugin NameSilo -PluginArgs $pArgs -DnsSleep 900
```

### Any OS

```powershell
$pArgs = @{ NameSiloKeyInsecure = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' }
New-PACertificate example.com -Plugin NameSilo -PluginArgs $pArgs -DnsSleep 900
```
