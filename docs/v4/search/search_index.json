The -Install parameter in New-PACertificate is not supported on non-Windows platforms and will throw an error if used because there's no certificate store equivalent to install to. On non-Windows OSes, [securestring] and [pscredential] plugins are not encrypted on disk by default because the encryption APIs used on Windows aren't available. However, you can enable AES based encryption that is also portable between OSes on a per-account level. This can be done during account creation or after the fact and you can switch between native and AES encryption at any time as in the following examples: # enable AES encryption during account creation New-PAAccount -AcceptTOS -Contact me @example . com -UseAltPluginEncryption # enable AES encryption on an existing account Set-PAAccount -UseAltPluginEncryption # switch back to OS-native encryption on an existing account Set-PAAccount -UseAltPluginEncryption : $false Key not valid for use in specified state \u00b6 This can happen on Windows if you try to copy the Posh-ACME profile folder to a different Windows computer or a different user's profile on the same computer. The underlying APIs used to encrypt plugin parameters using SecureString and PSCredential objects are tied to both the current computer and user and are not portable. However, you can use the Set-PAAccount -UseAltPluginEncryption to change the encryption used for the account to a portable AES based method and then copy the profile. The underlying connection was closed: Cloud not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. \u00b6 This shouldn't ever happen when using a publicly trusted certificate authority such as Let's Encrypt. If it does, an attacker or malware might be trying to MitM your connection. However if you're doing development against a test ACME server like Pebble or a private instance of Boulder , this is normal because the server is likely using a self-signed certificate. You can work around the problem by adding the -SkipCertificateCheck parameter to Set-PAServer . If the error seems to originate from one of the plugins, submit an issue and we can figure it out.

This will let us figure out all of the commands and parameters without likely running into the production server's rate limits . Set-PAServer LE_STAGE Note LE_STAGE is a shortcut for the Let's Encrypt Staging server's directory URL. You could do the same thing by specifying the actual URL which is https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory and this module should work with any ACME compliant directory URL. Other currently supported shortcuts include LE_PROD , BUYPASS_PROD , BUYPASS_TEST , and ZEROSSL_PROD . Once you set a server, the module will continue to perform future actions against that server until you change it with another call to Set-PAServer . The first time you connect to a server, a link to its Terms of Service will be displayed. You should review it before continuing. Your First Certificate \u00b6 The bare minimum you need to request a certificate is just the domain name. New-PACertificate example . com Since you haven't created an ACME account on this server yet, the command will attempt to create one for you using default settings and you'll get an error about having not agreed to the Terms of Service. Assuming you've reviewed the TOS link from before, add -AcceptTOS to the original command to proceed. You only need to do this once when creating a new account. You also probably want to associate an email address with this account so you can receive certificate expiration notifications. So let's do that even though it's not required. New-PACertificate example . com -AcceptTOS -Contact 'admin@example.com' Note Multiple email addresses per account are supported. Just pass it an array of addresses. Because you didn't specify a plugin, it will default to using the Manual DNS plugin. That manual plugin will also be prompting you to create a DNS TXT record to answer the ACME server's validation challenge for the domain. At this point, you can either press Ctrl+C to cancel the process and modify your command or go ahead and create the requested TXT record and hit any key to continue. We'll cover plugins next, so for now create the record manually and press a key to continue. If you run into problems creating the TXT record, check out Troubleshooting DNS Validation . The command will sleep for 2 minutes by default to allow the DNS changes to propagate. Then if the ACME server is able to properly validate the TXT record, the final certificate files are generated and the command should output the details of your new certificate. Only a subset of the details are displayed by default. To see them all, run Get-PACertificate | fl . The files generated in the output folder should contain the following: cert.cer (Base64 encoded PEM certificate) cert.key (Base64 encoded PEM private key) cert.pfx (PKCS12 container with cert+key) chain.cer (Base64 encoded PEM with the issuing CA chain) chainX.cer (Base64 encoded PEM with alternate issuing CA chains) fullchain.cer (Base64 encoded PEM with cert+chain) fullchain.pfx (PKCS12 container with cert+key+chain) Posh-ACME is only designed to obtain certificates, not deploy them to your web server or service. The certificate details are written to the pipeline so you can either save them to a variable or pipe the output to another command. Posh-ACME.Deploy is a sister module containing some example deployment functions for common services to get you started. But ultimately, it's up to you how you want to deploy your certificates. The password on the PFX files is poshacme because we didn't override the default with -PfxPass or -PfxPassSecure . If you're running PowerShell with elevated privileges on Windows, you can also add the -Install switch to automatically import the certificate into the local computer's certificate store. So now you have a certificate and that's great! But Let's Encrypt certificates expire relatively quickly (90 days). And you won't be able to renew this certificate without going through the manual DNS TXT record hassle again. So let's add a validation plugin to the process. Plugins \u00b6 The ACME protocol currently supports three types of challenges to prove you control the domain you're requesting a certificate for: dns-01 , http-01 , and tls-alpn-01 . We are going to focus on dns-01 because it is the only one that can be used to request wildcard (*.example.com) certificates and the majority of Posh-ACME plugins are for DNS providers . The ability to use a DNS plugin is going to depend on whether your DNS provider has a supported plugin in the current version of the module. If not, please submit an issue requesting support. If you have PowerShell development skills, you might also try writing a plugin yourself. Instructions can be found in the Plugins README . Pull requests for new plugins are both welcome and appreciated. It's also possible to redirect ACME DNS validations using a CNAME record in your primary zone pointing to another DNS server that is supported. More on that later. The first thing to do is figure out which DNS plugin to use and how to use it. Start by listing the available plugins. Get-PAPlugin Most plugins have a detailed usage guide here . In these examples, we'll use the AWS Route53 plugin. Here's a quick shortcut to get to the usage guide. This will open the default browser to the page on Windows and just display the URL on non-Windows. Get-PAPlugin Route53 -Guide Using a plugin will almost always require creating a hashtable with required plugin parameters. To see a quick reference of the available parameter sets try this: PS> Get-PAPlugin Route53 -Params Set Name: Keys (Default) Parameter Type IsMandatory --------- ---- ----------- R53AccessKey String True R53SecretKey SecureString True Set Name: KeysInsecure Parameter Type IsMandatory --------- ---- ----------- R53AccessKey String True R53SecretKeyInsecure String True Set Name: Profile Parameter Type IsMandatory --------- ---- ----------- R53ProfileName String True Set Name: IAMRole Parameter Type IsMandatory --------- ---- ----------- R53UseIAMRole SwitchParameter True We can see there are four different parameter sets we can use: Keys , KeysInsecure , Profile , and IAMRole . The Keys set requires R53AccessKey and R53SecretKey . These are API credentials for AWS and presumably as an AWS user, you already know how to generate them. The access key is just a normal String variable. But the secret key is a SecureString which takes a bit more effort to setup. So let's create the hashtable we need. $r53Secret = Read-Host 'Enter Secret' -AsSecureString $pArgs = @{ R53AccessKey = 'ABCD1234' ; R53SecretKey = $r53Secret } This $pArgs variable is what we'll pass to the -PluginArgs parameter on functions that use it. Now we know what plugin we're using and we have our plugin arguments in a hashtable. If this is the first time using a particular plugin, it's usually wise to test it before actually trying to use it for a new certificate. So let's do that. The command has no output unless we add the -Verbose switch to show what's going on under the hood. # get a reference to the current account $acct = Get-PAAccount Publish-Challenge example . com -Account $acct -Token faketoken -Plugin Route53 -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose Assuming there was no error, you should be able to validate that the TXT record was created in the Route53 management console. If so, go ahead and unpublish the record. Otherwise, troubleshoot why it failed and get it working before moving on. Unpublish-Challenge example . com -Account $acct -Token faketoken -Plugin Route53 -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose All we have left to do is add the necessary plugin parameters to our original certificate request command. But let's get crazy and change it up a bit by making the cert a wildcard cert with the root domain as a subject alternative name (SAN) . New-PACertificate '*.example.com' , 'example.com' -AcceptTOS -Contact 'admin@example.com' -Plugin Route53 ` -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose Warning According to current Let's Encrypt rate limits , a single certificate can have up to 100 names. The only caveat is that wildcard certs may not contain any SANs that would overlap with the wildcard entry. So you'll get an error if you try to put *.example.com and www.example.com in the same cert. But *.example.com and example.com or www.sub.example.com are just fine. We included the -Verbose switch again so we can see what's going on. But normally, that wouldn't be necessary. Assuming everything went well, you should now have a fresh new wildcard cert that required no user interaction. Keep in mind, HTTP plugins work the exactly the same way as DNS plugins. They just can't be used to validate wildcard names in certs from Let's Encrypt. Renewals and Deployment \u00b6 Now that you have a cert order that can successfully answer DNS challenges via a plugin, it's even easier to renew it. Submit-Renewal Note Be aware that renewals don\u2019t count against your Certificates per Registered Domain limit, but they are subject to a Duplicate Certificate limit of 5 per week. The module saves all of the parameters associated with an order and re-uses the same values to renew it. It will throw a warning right now because the cert hasn't reached the suggested renewal window. But you can use -Force to do it anyway if you want to try it. Let's Encrypt currently caches authorizations for roughly 30 days, so the forced renewal won't need to go through validating the challenges again. But you can de-authorize your existing challenges using the following command if you want to test the validation process again. Get-PAOrder | Revoke-PAAuthorization If you have multiple orders on an account or even multiple accounts, there are flags to renew all of those as well. # renew all orders on the current account Submit-Renewal -AllOrders # renew all orders across all accounts in the current profile Submit-Renewal -AllAccounts Note The -Force parameter works with these as well. Task Scheduler / Cron \u00b6 Because PowerShell has no native way to run recurring tasks, you'll need to set something up using whatever job scheduling utility your OS provides like Task Scheduler on Windows or cron on Linux. It is suggested to run the job once or twice a day at ideally randomized times. At the very least, try not to run them directly on any hour marks to avoid potential load spikes on the ACME server. Generally, the task must run as the same user you're currently logged in as because the Posh-ACME config is stored in your local user profile. However, it's possible to change the default config location . As mentioned earlier, Posh-ACME doesn't handle certificate deployment. So you'll likely want to create a script to both renew the cert and deploy it to your service/application. All the details you should need to deploy the cert are in the PACertificate object that is returned by Submit-Renewal . It's also the same object returned by New-PACertificate and Get-PACertificate ; the latter being useful to test deployment scripts with. Submit-Renewal will only return PACertificate objects for certs that were actually renewed successfully. So the typical template for a renew/deploy script might look something like this. Set-PAOrder example . com if ( $cert = Submit-Renewal ) { # do stuff with $cert to deploy it } For a job that is renewing multiple certificates, it might look more like this. Submit-Renewal -AllOrders | ForEach -Object { $cert = $_ if ( $cert . MainDomain -eq 'example.com' ) { # deploy for example.com } elseif ( $cert . MainDomain -eq 'example.net' ) { # deploy for example.com } else { # deploy for everything else } } Updating Plugin Parameters on Renewal \u00b6 Credentials and Tokens can change over time and some plugins can be used with purposefully short-lived access tokens. In these cases, you can specify the new plugin parameters using the -PluginArgs parameter on either Set-PAOrder or Submit-Renewal . The full set of plugin arguments must be specified. As an example, consider the case for the Azure DNS plugin: # renew specifying new plugin arguments Submit-Renewal -PluginArgs @{ AZSubscriptionId = 'mysubscriptionid' ; AZAccessToken = 'myaccesstoken' } Going Into Production \u00b6 Now that you've got everything working against the Let's Encrypt staging server, all you have to do is switch over to the production server and re-run your New-PACertificate command to get your shiny new publicly trusted certificate. Set-PAServer LE_PROD New-PACertificate '*.example.com' , 'example.com' -AcceptTOS -Contact 'admin@example.com' ` -Plugin Route53 -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose Modifying Certificate Names \u00b6 You may eventually need to add or remove names from your certificate to accommodate changes in the services you're hosting. But certificates can't be modified after they're generated. So you need to request a new certificate with the updated set of names. While you could just re-run your New-PACertificate command with a modified domain list and all the other original parameters and plugin details, that can be a hassle if it has been a while since you originally setup the certificate and don't remember exactly what you ran. However, all you really need is the modified domain list and the order name. Grab the the order details for the order you'll be modifying and create a hashtable for splatting with the Name and Domain parameters. $o = Get-PAOrder -Name example . com $newCertParams = @{ Name = $o . Name ; Domain = @( $o . MainDomain )+@( $o . SANs ) } Now modify the Domain parameter in the hashtable however you need to. Here are a couple examples. # add a new name $newCertParams . Domain += 'blog.example.com' # remove an existing name $newCertParams . Domain = $newCertParams . Domain | ?{ $_ -ne 'oldsite.example.com' } Finally, run New-PACertificate and splat your updated parameters. New-PACertificate @newCertParams -Verbose The function should pick up all the old parameters from the previous order (finding it via the Name parameter) and create a new order/cert that overwrites the old one.","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"Tutorial/#tutorial","text":"","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"Tutorial/#picking-a-server","text":"Before we begin, let's configure our ACME server to be the Let's Encrypt Staging server. This will let us figure out all of the commands and parameters without likely running into the production server's rate limits . Set-PAServer LE_STAGE Note LE_STAGE is a shortcut for the Let's Encrypt Staging server's directory URL. You could do the same thing by specifying the actual URL which is https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory and this module should work with any ACME compliant directory URL. Other currently supported shortcuts include LE_PROD , BUYPASS_PROD , BUYPASS_TEST , and ZEROSSL_PROD . Once you set a server, the module will continue to perform future actions against that server until you change it with another call to Set-PAServer . The first time you connect to a server, a link to its Terms of Service will be displayed. You should review it before continuing.","title":"Picking a Server"},{"location":"Tutorial/#your-first-certificate","text":"The bare minimum you need to request a certificate is just the domain name. New-PACertificate example . com Since you haven't created an ACME account on this server yet, the command will attempt to create one for you using default settings and you'll get an error about having not agreed to the Terms of Service. Assuming you've reviewed the TOS link from before, add -AcceptTOS to the original command to proceed. You only need to do this once when creating a new account. You also probably want to associate an email address with this account so you can receive certificate expiration notifications. So let's do that even though it's not required. New-PACertificate example . com -AcceptTOS -Contact 'admin@example.com' Note Multiple email addresses per account are supported. Just pass it an array of addresses. Because you didn't specify a plugin, it will default to using the Manual DNS plugin. That manual plugin will also be prompting you to create a DNS TXT record to answer the ACME server's validation challenge for the domain. At this point, you can either press Ctrl+C to cancel the process and modify your command or go ahead and create the requested TXT record and hit any key to continue. We'll cover plugins next, so for now create the record manually and press a key to continue. If you run into problems creating the TXT record, check out Troubleshooting DNS Validation . The command will sleep for 2 minutes by default to allow the DNS changes to propagate. Then if the ACME server is able to properly validate the TXT record, the final certificate files are generated and the command should output the details of your new certificate. Only a subset of the details are displayed by default. To see them all, run Get-PACertificate | fl . The files generated in the output folder should contain the following: cert.cer (Base64 encoded PEM certificate) cert.key (Base64 encoded PEM private key) cert.pfx (PKCS12 container with cert+key) chain.cer (Base64 encoded PEM with the issuing CA chain) chainX.cer (Base64 encoded PEM with alternate issuing CA chains) fullchain.cer (Base64 encoded PEM with cert+chain) fullchain.pfx (PKCS12 container with cert+key+chain) Posh-ACME is only designed to obtain certificates, not deploy them to your web server or service. The certificate details are written to the pipeline so you can either save them to a variable or pipe the output to another command. Posh-ACME.Deploy is a sister module containing some example deployment functions for common services to get you started. But ultimately, it's up to you how you want to deploy your certificates. The password on the PFX files is poshacme because we didn't override the default with -PfxPass or -PfxPassSecure . If you're running PowerShell with elevated privileges on Windows, you can also add the -Install switch to automatically import the certificate into the local computer's certificate store. So now you have a certificate and that's great! But Let's Encrypt certificates expire relatively quickly (90 days). And you won't be able to renew this certificate without going through the manual DNS TXT record hassle again. So let's add a validation plugin to the process.","title":"Your First Certificate"},{"location":"Tutorial/#plugins","text":"The ACME protocol currently supports three types of challenges to prove you control the domain you're requesting a certificate for: dns-01 , http-01 , and tls-alpn-01 . We are going to focus on dns-01 because it is the only one that can be used to request wildcard (*.example.com) certificates and the majority of Posh-ACME plugins are for DNS providers . The ability to use a DNS plugin is going to depend on whether your DNS provider has a supported plugin in the current version of the module. If not, please submit an issue requesting support. If you have PowerShell development skills, you might also try writing a plugin yourself. Instructions can be found in the Plugins README . Pull requests for new plugins are both welcome and appreciated. It's also possible to redirect ACME DNS validations using a CNAME record in your primary zone pointing to another DNS server that is supported. More on that later. The first thing to do is figure out which DNS plugin to use and how to use it. Start by listing the available plugins. Get-PAPlugin Most plugins have a detailed usage guide here . In these examples, we'll use the AWS Route53 plugin. Here's a quick shortcut to get to the usage guide. This will open the default browser to the page on Windows and just display the URL on non-Windows. Get-PAPlugin Route53 -Guide Using a plugin will almost always require creating a hashtable with required plugin parameters. To see a quick reference of the available parameter sets try this: PS> Get-PAPlugin Route53 -Params Set Name: Keys (Default) Parameter Type IsMandatory --------- ---- ----------- R53AccessKey String True R53SecretKey SecureString True Set Name: KeysInsecure Parameter Type IsMandatory --------- ---- ----------- R53AccessKey String True R53SecretKeyInsecure String True Set Name: Profile Parameter Type IsMandatory --------- ---- ----------- R53ProfileName String True Set Name: IAMRole Parameter Type IsMandatory --------- ---- ----------- R53UseIAMRole SwitchParameter True We can see there are four different parameter sets we can use: Keys , KeysInsecure , Profile , and IAMRole . The Keys set requires R53AccessKey and R53SecretKey . These are API credentials for AWS and presumably as an AWS user, you already know how to generate them. The access key is just a normal String variable. But the secret key is a SecureString which takes a bit more effort to setup. So let's create the hashtable we need. $r53Secret = Read-Host 'Enter Secret' -AsSecureString $pArgs = @{ R53AccessKey = 'ABCD1234' ; R53SecretKey = $r53Secret } This $pArgs variable is what we'll pass to the -PluginArgs parameter on functions that use it. Now we know what plugin we're using and we have our plugin arguments in a hashtable. If this is the first time using a particular plugin, it's usually wise to test it before actually trying to use it for a new certificate. So let's do that. The command has no output unless we add the -Verbose switch to show what's going on under the hood. # get a reference to the current account $acct = Get-PAAccount Publish-Challenge example . com -Account $acct -Token faketoken -Plugin Route53 -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose Assuming there was no error, you should be able to validate that the TXT record was created in the Route53 management console. If so, go ahead and unpublish the record. Otherwise, troubleshoot why it failed and get it working before moving on. Unpublish-Challenge example . com -Account $acct -Token faketoken -Plugin Route53 -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose All we have left to do is add the necessary plugin parameters to our original certificate request command. But let's get crazy and change it up a bit by making the cert a wildcard cert with the root domain as a subject alternative name (SAN) . New-PACertificate '*.example.com' , 'example.com' -AcceptTOS -Contact 'admin@example.com' -Plugin Route53 ` -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose Warning According to current Let's Encrypt rate limits , a single certificate can have up to 100 names. The only caveat is that wildcard certs may not contain any SANs that would overlap with the wildcard entry. So you'll get an error if you try to put *.example.com and www.example.com in the same cert. But *.example.com and example.com or www.sub.example.com are just fine. We included the -Verbose switch again so we can see what's going on. But normally, that wouldn't be necessary. Assuming everything went well, you should now have a fresh new wildcard cert that required no user interaction. Keep in mind, HTTP plugins work the exactly the same way as DNS plugins. They just can't be used to validate wildcard names in certs from Let's Encrypt.","title":"Plugins"},{"location":"Tutorial/#renewals-and-deployment","text":"Now that you have a cert order that can successfully answer DNS challenges via a plugin, it's even easier to renew it. Submit-Renewal Note Be aware that renewals don\u2019t count against your Certificates per Registered Domain limit, but they are subject to a Duplicate Certificate limit of 5 per week. The module saves all of the parameters associated with an order and re-uses the same values to renew it. It will throw a warning right now because the cert hasn't reached the suggested renewal window. But you can use -Force to do it anyway if you want to try it. Let's Encrypt currently caches authorizations for roughly 30 days, so the forced renewal won't need to go through validating the challenges again. But you can de-authorize your existing challenges using the following command if you want to test the validation process again. Get-PAOrder | Revoke-PAAuthorization If you have multiple orders on an account or even multiple accounts, there are flags to renew all of those as well. # renew all orders on the current account Submit-Renewal -AllOrders # renew all orders across all accounts in the current profile Submit-Renewal -AllAccounts Note The -Force parameter works with these as well.","title":"Renewals and Deployment"},{"location":"Tutorial/#task-scheduler-cron","text":"Because PowerShell has no native way to run recurring tasks, you'll need to set something up using whatever job scheduling utility your OS provides like Task Scheduler on Windows or cron on Linux. It is suggested to run the job once or twice a day at ideally randomized times. At the very least, try not to run them directly on any hour marks to avoid potential load spikes on the ACME server. Generally, the task must run as the same user you're currently logged in as because the Posh-ACME config is stored in your local user profile. However, it's possible to change the default config location . As mentioned earlier, Posh-ACME doesn't handle certificate deployment. So you'll likely want to create a script to both renew the cert and deploy it to your service/application. All the details you should need to deploy the cert are in the PACertificate object that is returned by Submit-Renewal . It's also the same object returned by New-PACertificate and Get-PACertificate ; the latter being useful to test deployment scripts with. Submit-Renewal will only return PACertificate objects for certs that were actually renewed successfully. So the typical template for a renew/deploy script might look something like this. Set-PAOrder example . com if ( $cert = Submit-Renewal ) { # do stuff with $cert to deploy it } For a job that is renewing multiple certificates, it might look more like this. Submit-Renewal -AllOrders | ForEach -Object { $cert = $_ if ( $cert . MainDomain -eq 'example.com' ) { # deploy for example.com } elseif ( $cert .

However, utilizing the module's other functions can enable more complicated workflows and reduce the number of parameters you need to supply to this function. Examples \u00b6 Example 1: Basic Manual Certificate \u00b6 New-PACertificate 'example.com' , 'www.example.com' -AcceptTOS This is the bare minimum necessary to create a certificate for a basic domain (plus the www alt name). It prompt you to add the required DNS TXT record manually. You can omit the -AcceptTOS parameter if you already have an ACME account configured. Example 2: Wildcard Certificate with Contact \u00b6 New-PACertificate '*.example.com' , 'example.com' -Contact 'admin@example.com' Wildcard certificates generally include the non-wildcard root as a SAN because the wildcard doesn't match it. The contact email address is typically used by the CA to send expiration warnings. Example 3: Using a plugin \u00b6 $pArgs = @{ FDToken = ( Read-Host 'FakeDNS API Token' -AsSecureString ) } New-PACertificate 'example.com' -Plugin FakeDNS -PluginArgs $pArgs Plugin parameters are passed as a basic hashtable object. Some parameters may require SecureString or PSCredential objects to protect sensitive API credentials, tokens, and keys. Example 4: Using multiple plugins \u00b6 $pArgs = @{ FDToken = ( Read-Host 'FakeDNS API Token' -AsSecureString ) WSHPort = 8080 } New-PACertificate '*.example.com' , 'example.com' -Plugin FakeDNS , WebSelfHost -PluginArgs $pArgs Each name in a certificate can use a different plugin if necessary. Be sure the specified plugin order matches the order of the names they are associated with. If there are fewer plugins specified than names, the last plugin in the list will be applied to all remaining names. Each plugin's parameters should be combined into the same hashtable object. Example 5: Using a DNS Challenge Alias \u00b6 $pArgs = @{ FDToken = ( Read-Host 'FakeDNS API Token' -AsSecureString ) } New-PACertificate 'example.com' -Plugin FakeDNS -PluginArgs $pArgs -DnsAlias 'acme.example.net' Using DnsAlias tells the plugin to create the required TXT record to an alternate hostname. It requires having added a CNAME record for each name in the cert pointing to the alternate record location. In this case, _acme-challenge.example.com is pointing to acme.example.net . Parameters \u00b6 -Domain \u00b6 One or more domain names to include in this order/certificate. The first one in the list will be considered the \"MainDomain\" and be set as the subject of the finalized certificate. Type : String[] Parameter Sets : FromScratch Aliases : Required : True Position : 1 Default value : None Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -CSRPath \u00b6 The path to a pre-made certificate request file in PEM (Base64) format. This is useful for appliances that need to generate their own keys and cert requests. Type : String Parameter Sets : FromCSR Aliases : Required : True Position : 1 Default value : None Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -Name \u00b6 The name of the ACME order. This can be useful to distinguish between two orders that have the same MainDomain. Type : String Parameter Sets : (All) Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : None Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -Contact \u00b6 One or more email addresses to associate with this certificate. These addresses will be used by the ACME server to send certificate expiration notifications or other important account notices. Type : String[] Parameter Sets : (All) Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : None Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -CertKeyLength \u00b6 The type and size of private key to use for the certificate. For RSA keys, specify a number between 2048-4096 (divisible by 128). For ECC keys, specify either 'ec-256' or 'ec-384'. Defaults to '2048'. Type : String Parameter Sets : FromScratch Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : 2048 Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -AlwaysNewKey \u00b6 If specified, the order will be configured to always generate a new private key during each renewal. Otherwise, the old key is re-used if it exists. Type : SwitchParameter Parameter Sets : FromScratch Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : False Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -AcceptTOS \u00b6 This switch is required when creating a new account as part of a certificate request. It implies you have read and accepted the Terms of Service for the ACME server you are connected to. The first time you connect to an ACME server, a link to the Terms of Service should have been displayed. Type : SwitchParameter Parameter Sets : (All) Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : False Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -AccountKeyLength \u00b6 The type and size of private key to use for the account associated with this certificate. For RSA keys, specify a number between 2048-4096 (divisible by 128). For ECC keys, specify either 'ec-256' or 'ec-384'. Defaults to 'ec-256'. Type : String Parameter Sets : (All) Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : Ec-256 Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -DirectoryUrl \u00b6 Either the URL to an ACME server's \"directory\" endpoint or one of the supported short names. Currently supported short names include LE_PROD (LetsEncrypt Production), LE_STAGE (LetsEncrypt Staging), BUYPASS_PROD (BuyPass.com Production), BUYPASS_TEST (BuyPass.com Testing), and ZEROSSL_PROD (Zerossl.com Production). Type : String Parameter Sets : (All) Aliases : location Required : False Position : Named Default value : LE_PROD Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -Plugin \u00b6 One or more validation plugin names to use for this order's challenges. If no plugin is specified, the DNS \"Manual\" plugin will be used. If the same plugin is used for all domains in the order, you can just specify it once. Otherwise, you should specify as many plugin names as there are domains in the order and in the same sequence as the order. Type : String[] Parameter Sets : (All) Aliases : DnsPlugin Required : False Position : Named Default value : None Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -PluginArgs \u00b6 A hashtable containing the plugin arguments to use with the specified Plugin list. So if a plugin has a -MyText string and -MyNumber integer parameter, you could specify them as @{MyText='text';MyNumber=1234} . Type : Hashtable Parameter Sets : (All) Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : None Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -DnsAlias \u00b6 One or more FQDNs that DNS challenges should be published to instead of the certificate domain's zone. This is used in advanced setups where a CNAME in the certificate domain's zone has been pre-created to point to the alias's FQDN which makes the ACME server check the alias domain when validation challenge TXT records. If the same alias is used for all domains in the order, you can just specify it once. Otherwise, you should specify as many alias FQDNs as there are domains in the order and in the same sequence as the order. Type : String[] Parameter Sets : (All) Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : None Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -OCSPMustStaple \u00b6 If specified, the certificate generated for this order will have the OCSP Must-Staple flag set.

Type : String Parameter Sets : FromScratch Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : None Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -PfxPass \u00b6 Set the export password for generated PFX files. Defaults to 'poshacme'. When the PfxPassSecure parameter is specified, this parameter is ignored. Type : String Parameter Sets : FromScratch Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : Poshacme Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -PfxPassSecure \u00b6 Set the export password for generated PFX files using a SecureString value. When this parameter is specified, the PfxPass parameter is ignored. Type : SecureString Parameter Sets : FromScratch Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : None Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -Install \u00b6 If specified, the certificate generated for this order will be imported to the local computer's Personal certificate store. Using this switch requires running the command from an elevated PowerShell session. Type : SwitchParameter Parameter Sets : FromScratch Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : False Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -UseSerialValidation \u00b6 If specified, the names in the order will be validated individually rather than all at once. This can significantly increase the time it takes to process validations and should only be used for plugins that require it. The plugin's usage guide should indicate whether it is required. Type : SwitchParameter Parameter Sets : (All) Aliases : Required : False Position : Named Default value : False Accept pipeline input : False Accept wildcard characters : False -Force \u00b6 If specified, a new certificate order will always be created regardless of the status of a previous order for the same primary domain.

And while Posh-ACME primarily targets users who want to avoid understanding all of the protocol complexity, it also exposes functions that allow you to do things a bit closer to the protocol level than just running New-PACertificate and Submit-Renewal . This can enable more advanced automation scenarios such as supporting challenge types that the module doesn't directly support yet or responding to authorization challenges in a way not directly supported by existing plugins. This guide will walk through the ACME certificate request process and demonstrate how to manage the validation of authorization challenges. At a high level, the ACME conversation looks more or less like this: Create an account Create a certificate order Prove control of the \"identifiers\" (DNS names or IP addresses) in the requested cert by answering challenges. Finalize the order by submitting an certificate request (CSR) Download the signed certificate and chain Warning IP Address identifiers ( RFC 8738 ) are supported by Posh-ACME. But they're not yet supported by any ACME-compatible public certificate authorities that I'm aware of. If you want to test them, you'll have to use Pebble . If you're curious about what's going on under the hood during this guide, add -Verbose to your commands or run $VerbosePreference = 'Continue' . If you really want to get deep, you can also turn on debug logging by running $DebugPreference = 'Continue' which will also display the raw JSON requests and responses. The defaults for both of those preferences are SilentlyContinue if you want to change them back later. Server Selection \u00b6 While testing code, you should not use the production Let's Encrypt server. The staging server is the easiest alternative, but still has some rate limits that you can run afoul of if your code goes crazy. There is also Pebble which is a tiny ACME server you can self-host and is built for testing code against. For simplicity, we'll select the Let's Encrypt staging server. Set-PAServer LE_STAGE Account Setup \u00b6 Requesting a certificate always starts with creating an account on the ACME server which is basically just a public/private key pair that is used to sign the protocol messages you send to the server along with some metadata like one or more email addresses to send expiration notifications to. If you've been previously using the module against the staging server, you likely already have an account. If so, you can either skip this section or create a second account which is also supported. New-PAAccount -AcceptTOS -Contact 'me@example.com' Warning If you're using Pebble as your ACME server, it doesn't save accounts or order details when you shut it down. So you'll have to re-create accounts and orders if you exit and restart it. Create an Order \u00b6 The only required parameter for a new order is the set of names you want included in the certificate. Optional parameters include things like -KeyLength to change the private key type/size, -Install which tells Posh-ACME to automatically store the signed cert in the Windows certificate store (requires local admin) , and -PfxPass which lets you set the decryption password for the certificate PFX file. If we were using plugins, this is also where you could set which plugin to use and the parameters associated with it. In this example, we'll create a typical wildcard cert that contains a root domain and the wildcard version of it. Keep in mind that wildcard names require using DNS challenge validation . So if you're testing HTTP challenge validation, either leave that one out or add a different non-wildcard name. $domains = 'example.com' , '*.example.com' New-PAOrder $domains Assuming you didn't use names that were previously validated on this account, you should get output that looks something like this where the status is pending . If the status is ready , create an order with different names that haven't been previously validated. MainDomain status KeyLength SANs OCSPMustStaple CertExpires Plugin ---------- ------ --------- ---- -------------- ----------- ------ example.com pending 2048 {*.example.com} False {Manual} Authorizations and Challenges \u00b6 The distinction between an order, authorization, and challenge can be confusing if you're not familiar with the ACME protocol. So let's clarify first. An order is a request for a certificate that contains one or more \"identifiers\" (a name like example.com ). Each identifier in an order has an authorization object associated with it that indicates whether the account that created the order is authorized to get a cert for that name. New authorizations start in a pending state awaiting the client to complete a challenge associated with that authorization. Each authorization can have multiple different challenges (DNS, HTTP, ALPN, etc) that indicate the different methods the ACME server will accept to prove ownership of the name. You only need to complete one of the offered challenges in order to satisfy an authorization. Note Different types of identifiers may only allow a subset of challenge types. For instance, wildcard DNS names can only be validated by a DNS challenge and IP addresses can only be validated by HTTP or ALPN challenges. Get-PAAuthorization can be used with the output of Get-PAOrder to retrieve the current set of authorizations (and their challenges) for an order. So lets put those details into a variable and display them. $auths = Get-PAOrder | Get-PAAuthorization $auths This should give an output that looks something like this. The first status column is the overall status of the authorization. The last two columns are the status of the dns-01 and http-01 challenges. Normally the challenge specific details are buried a bit deeper in a challenges property, but Posh-ACME tries to help by surfacing the commonly used challenge details on the root object. Notice also how the wildcard name has no HTTP01Status because it was not offered as a valid challenge type for that identifier. fqdn status Expires DNS01Status HTTP01Status ---- ------ ------- ----------- ------------ example.com pending 12/24/2020 7:14:33 PM pending pending *.example.com pending 12/24/2020 7:14:33 PM pending Let's take a look at the full details of one of the authorization objects by running $auths[0] | fl . You should get an output like this: identifier : @{type=dns; value=example.com} status : pending expires : 2020-12-25T16:52:23Z challenges : {@{type=dns-01; status=pending; url=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/challenge/<AUTH_ID>/<DNS_CHAL_ID>; token=<DNS_TOKEN>}, @{type=http-01; status=pending; url=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/challenge/<AUTH_ID>/<HTTP_CHAL_ID>; token=<HTTP_TOKEN>}, @{type=tls-alpn-01; status=pending; url=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/challenge/<AUTH_ID>/<ALPN_CHAL_ID>; token=<ALPN_TOKEN>}} DNSId : example.com fqdn : example.com location : https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/authz/<AUTH_ID> DNS01Status : pending DNS01Url : https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/challenge/<AUTH_ID>/<DNS_CHAL_ID> DNS01Token : <DNS_TOKEN> HTTP01Status : pending HTTP01Url : https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/challenge/<AUTH_ID>/<HTTP_CHAL_ID> HTTP01Token : <HTTP_TOKEN> For this identifier, the ACME server has offered all three challenge types: http-01 , dns-01 , and tls-alpn-01 . In addition to the type, each challenge contains a status , url and token property. For HTTP and DNS challenges, these can also be read from the root authorization object using the HTTP01xxx and DNS01xxx properties. We'll go over how to use the tokens in the next couple sections about publishing challenges. Publishing an HTTP Challenge \u00b6 For an HTTP challenge, the ACME server must be able send an HTTP GET request to a particular URL on port 80 and receive a key authorization value which is based on the token value in the challenge and the public key thumbprint of your account key. You can build the URL using the following template: $url = 'http://{0}/.well-known/acme-challenge/{1}' -f $auths [ 0 ]. DNSId , $auths [ 0 ]. HTTP01Token Note Most ACME servers will follow HTTP 3xx redirect responses, but the initial request will always be non-TLS to port 80. So you must not block port 80 on your web server if you want to use HTTP challenges. The key authorization can be generated using Get-KeyAuthorization like this. $keyauth = Get-KeyAuthorization $auths [ 0 ]. HTTP01Token Now it's up to you to setup your web server so it responds with the key authorization value when the URL is queried from the Internet. If it's only queryable from your internal LAN, the challenge validation will fail. Note If you're using PowerShell functions to create the challenge files, make sure to specify ASCII/ANSI file encoding. Line endings shouldn't matter, but the encoding does in my testing. So if you're using Out-File , add -Encoding ascii . Publishing a DNS Challenge \u00b6 For a DNS challenge, the ACME server must be able send an TXT record query for a particular record name and receive a key authorization value in the response which is similar to the value it wants for an HTTP challenge. You can build the record name using the following template: $recName = '_acme-challenge.{0}' -f $auths [ 1 ]. DNSId The key authorization can be generated using Get-KeyAuthorization like this. Note the extra -ForDNS parameter compared to the HTTP challenge and the reference to DNS01Token instead of HTTP01Token . Each challenge type within an authorization has a unique token value. $keyauth = Get-KeyAuthorization $auths [ 1 ]. DNS01Token -ForDNS The astute reader may have realized that in our example, this means the name of the TXT record would be the same for both identifiers, example.com and *.example.com . They both translate to _acme-challenge.example.com . This tends to confuse people at first, but it's really no different than having multiple A records pointing to different IPs for a website. The ACME validation server is smart enough to check all of the returned results and find the one it cares about. Now it's up to you to publish the record on your DNS server that is queryable from the Internet. Depending on your DNS provider and its replication topology, it may take anywhere from seconds to minutes for the records you create to be queryable from the Internet. Make sure you either know how long it's supposed to take and wait that long before proceeding, or query your authoritative external nameservers directly until they return the expected results. Warning In DNS providers that use anycast even if you successfully query the nameserver for your record from your location, it may still fail from other locations in the world due to propagation delays. Some providers have an API you can query to know when it is fully propagated. Others don't and you just have to wait longer. Note ACME validation servers will also follow CNAME records to validate challenges. This can be useful if your primary DNS server has no API or the security posture of your organization doesn't allow an automated process such as an ACME client to have write access to the zone you need to create TXT records within. If you know this will be the case, you can create a permanent CNAME record for the _acme-challenge.<FQDN> name that points to another FQDN somewhere else. Then write your TXT record to that other target and as long as that zone is still Internet-facing, the validation will succeed. Publishing a TLS-ALPN Challenge \u00b6 At the time of this writing, I don't know enough about ALPN to authoritatively write a section on how to use it. But I know it's dependent on the web server software you're using. Here is Let's Encrypt's documentation on the subject. Notify the ACME Server \u00b6 Now that you've published all of your key validations for all of your challenges, you're ready to ask the ACME server to check them. The requires the url property from the challenge you published which for HTTP/DNS challenges can also be read from HTTP01Url or DNS01Url on the root authorization object. Use the Send-ChallengeAck function like this. # if all of your challenges were published using the same challenge type such as HTTP $auths . HTTP01Url | Send-ChallengeAck # if you published challenges of different types, make sure to use the specific URLs associated with them $auths [ 0 ]. HTTP01Url | Send-ChallengeAck $auths [ 1 ]. DNS01Url | Send-ChallengeAck The challenges are usually validated quickly. But there may be a delay if the ACME server is overloaded. You can poll the status of your authorizations by re-running Get-PAOrder | Get-PAAuthorization . Eventually, the status for each one will either be \"valid\" or \"invalid\". Good output should look something like this. Notice how the overall status for each challenge is valid while the individual challenge status is only valid for the specific challenge types we published. fqdn status Expires DNS01Status HTTP01Status ---- ------ ------- ----------- ------------ example.com valid 12/24/2020 7:14:33 PM valid *.example.com valid 12/24/2020 7:14:33 PM valid Finishing Up \u00b6 Now that you have all of your identifiers authorized, your order status should now be \"ready\" which you can check with Get-PAOrder -Refresh . It should look something like this. MainDomain status KeyLength SANs OCSPMustStaple CertExpires Plugin ---------- ------ --------- ---- -------------- ----------- ------ example.com ready 2048 {*.example.com} False {Manual} The next step is \"finalization\" in which you send a the actual x509 certificate request (CSR) to the ACME server. Run the following: Submit-OrderFinalize If you run Get-PAOrder -Refresh again, your order status should now be valid which means you're ready to download the final signed certificate. Run the following to let Posh-ACME take care of that and build the various combinations of PEM/PFX files. Complete-PAOrder This will also output the final certificate details that should look something like this. Subject NotAfter KeyLength Thumbprint AllSANs ------- -------- --------- ---------- ------- CN=example.com 3/15/2021 4:37:37 PM 2048 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX {example.com, *.example.com} It is also the same output you get from Get-PACertificate . Run Get-PACertificate | fl to get a full list of cert properties including the filesystem paths where the files are stored. Debugging Challenge Failures \u00b6 If for some reason one or more of your challenge validations failed, you can retrieve the error details from the ACME server like this. ( Get-PAOrder | Get-PAAuthorization ). challenges . error | fl Revoking Authorizations \u00b6 Let's Encrypt and other ACME CAs will generally cache authorizations associated with an account for a period of time. Let's Encrypt caches them for around 30 days which means that if you request another cert in that timeframe with an identifier/name that you've already authorized, the authorization objects won't need to be re-validated. Their status will be immediately valid. This can be annoying if you're trying to test your challenge validation automation. However, you can revoke your existing authorizations for a given order like this: # NOTE: Without -Force, there will be a confirmation prompt for each name being revoked. Get-PAorder | Revoke-PAAuthorization -Force This process does not revoke the certificate . It only revokes the authorizations so that you need to re-validate those names when you request a new certificate that contains them. Renewals \u00b6 The concept of a renewal doesn't actually exist in the ACME protocol. What most clients call a renewal is just a new order with the same parameters as last time. So the only thing extra you need to deal with is knowing when to renew. When you successfully complete a certificate order, Posh-ACME will attach a RenewAfter property to the order object which you can use to calculate whether it's time to renew or not. The property is an ISO 8601 date/time string which can be parsed and checked with DateTimeOffset like this. $renewAfter = [DateTimeOffset] :: Parse (( Get-PAOrder ).

And while Posh-ACME primarily targets users who want to avoid understanding all of the protocol complexity, it also exposes functions that allow you to do things a bit closer to the protocol level than just running New-PACertificate and Submit-Renewal . This can enable more advanced automation scenarios such as supporting challenge types that the module doesn't directly support yet or responding to authorization challenges in a way not directly supported by existing plugins. This guide will walk through the ACME certificate request process and demonstrate how to manage the validation of authorization challenges. At a high level, the ACME conversation looks more or less like this: Create an account Create a certificate order Prove control of the \"identifiers\" (DNS names or IP addresses) in the requested cert by answering challenges. Finalize the order by submitting an certificate request (CSR) Download the signed certificate and chain Warning IP Address identifiers ( RFC 8738 ) are supported by Posh-ACME. But they're not yet supported by any ACME-compatible public certificate authorities that I'm aware of. If you want to test them, you'll have to use Pebble . If you're curious about what's going on under the hood during this guide, add -Verbose to your commands or run $VerbosePreference = 'Continue' . If you really want to get deep, you can also turn on debug logging by running $DebugPreference = 'Continue' which will also display the raw JSON requests and responses.

Optional parameters include things like -KeyLength to change the private key type/size, -Install which tells Posh-ACME to automatically store the signed cert in the Windows certificate store (requires local admin) , and -PfxPass which lets you set the decryption password for the certificate PFX file. If we were using plugins, this is also where you could set which plugin to use and the parameters associated with it. In this example, we'll create a typical wildcard cert that contains a root domain and the wildcard version of it. Keep in mind that wildcard names require using DNS challenge validation . So if you're testing HTTP challenge validation, either leave that one out or add a different non-wildcard name. $domains = 'example.com' , '*.example.com' New-PAOrder $domains Assuming you didn't use names that were previously validated on this account, you should get output that looks something like this where the status is pending .

So let's clarify first. An order is a request for a certificate that contains one or more \"identifiers\" (a name like example.com ). Each identifier in an order has an authorization object associated with it that indicates whether the account that created the order is authorized to get a cert for that name. New authorizations start in a pending state awaiting the client to complete a challenge associated with that authorization. Each authorization can have multiple different challenges (DNS, HTTP, ALPN, etc) that indicate the different methods the ACME server will accept to prove ownership of the name. You only need to complete one of the offered challenges in order to satisfy an authorization. Note Different types of identifiers may only allow a subset of challenge types. For instance, wildcard DNS names can only be validated by a DNS challenge and IP addresses can only be validated by HTTP or ALPN challenges. Get-PAAuthorization can be used with the output of Get-PAOrder to retrieve the current set of authorizations (and their challenges) for an order. So lets put those details into a variable and display them. $auths = Get-PAOrder | Get-PAAuthorization $auths This should give an output that looks something like this. The first status column is the overall status of the authorization. The last two columns are the status of the dns-01 and http-01 challenges. Normally the challenge specific details are buried a bit deeper in a challenges property, but Posh-ACME tries to help by surfacing the commonly used challenge details on the root object. Notice also how the wildcard name has no HTTP01Status because it was not offered as a valid challenge type for that identifier. fqdn status Expires DNS01Status HTTP01Status ---- ------ ------- ----------- ------------ example.com pending 12/24/2020 7:14:33 PM pending pending *.example.com pending 12/24/2020 7:14:33 PM pending Let's take a look at the full details of one of the authorization objects by running $auths[0] | fl .

In addition to the type, each challenge contains a status , url and token property.

HTTP01Token Note Most ACME servers will follow HTTP 3xx redirect responses, but the initial request will always be non-TLS to port 80.

The key authorization can be generated using Get-KeyAuthorization like this. $keyauth = Get-KeyAuthorization $auths [ 0 ]. HTTP01Token Now it's up to you to setup your web server so it responds with the key authorization value when the URL is queried from the Internet. If it's only queryable from your internal LAN, the challenge validation will fail.

Each challenge type within an authorization has a unique token value. $keyauth = Get-KeyAuthorization $auths [ 1 ]. DNS01Token -ForDNS The astute reader may have realized that in our example, this means the name of the TXT record would be the same for both identifiers, example.com and *.example.com . They both translate to _acme-challenge.example.com . This tends to confuse people at first, but it's really no different than having multiple A records pointing to different IPs for a website. The ACME validation server is smart enough to check all of the returned results and find the one it cares about. Now it's up to you to publish the record on your DNS server that is queryable from the Internet. Depending on your DNS provider and its replication topology, it may take anywhere from seconds to minutes for the records you create to be queryable from the Internet. Make sure you either know how long it's supposed to take and wait that long before proceeding, or query your authoritative external nameservers directly until they return the expected results. Warning In DNS providers that use anycast even if you successfully query the nameserver for your record from your location, it may still fail from other locations in the world due to propagation delays. Some providers have an API you can query to know when it is fully propagated. Others don't and you just have to wait longer. Note ACME validation servers will also follow CNAME records to validate challenges. This can be useful if your primary DNS server has no API or the security posture of your organization doesn't allow an automated process such as an ACME client to have write access to the zone you need to create TXT records within. If you know this will be the case, you can create a permanent CNAME record for the _acme-challenge.<FQDN> name that points to another FQDN somewhere else.

There are a number of reasons why this might be the case and in this guide, we'll go over some of the possibilities. But first, let's review how to query TXT records. Querying TXT records \u00b6 nslookup is the primary tool most people use to do DNS queries from Windows because it's installed by default and available on every Windows OS since basically forever. PowerShell has Resolve-DnsName but only since Windows 8/2012. So we'll focus on nslookup for now. C:\\>nslookup -q=txt _acme-challenge.example.com. Don't forget the final . on the domain name. This is the basic command that will query your local DNS server. But it's usually wise to specifically query a public DNS resolver like Google (8.8.8.8) or CloudFlare (1.1.1.1) in case you're in a split-brain DNS environment. However, some businesses are starting to deploy firewalls that block outbound DNS requests like this. So make sure you are able to query a known good record before tearing your hair out troubleshooting the record you're having trouble with. Here's how to explicitly query an external resolver. C:\\>nslookup -q=txt _acme-challenge.example.com. 1.1.1.1 If the query was successful, the output might look something like this: Server: 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com Address: 1.1.1.1 Non-authoritative answer: _acme-challenge.example.com text = \"asdfa7sdcv6qn4klav7127134\" Otherwise, it will be more like this: Server: 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com Address: 1.1.1.1 *** 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com can't find _acme-challenge.example.com: Non-existent domain DNS Propagation Delays \u00b6 In many environments, the DNS server you are adding records to is not the same server that the Internet is sending queries to. Depending on the server and the DNS architecture, there may be both database replication delays and DNS zone transfer delays to slave servers. By default, Posh-ACME sleeps for 2 minutes after writing TXT records for a certificate before it asks the ACME server to validate them. But 2 minutes might not be long enough for your particular environment. In that case, use the -DnsSleep parameter to modify the default sleep time. It takes a value in seconds.

Internal vs External DNS \u00b6 Particularly in business environments, it is common to have a split-brain DNS architecture which basically means there might be two different \"views\" of a particular zone, one internal and one external. The internal view might resolve example.com to an internal IP like 10.0.0.50 . But the external view for the same name might resolve to public IP like 203.0.113.50 . Make sure that you only add your DNS challenge TXT records to the External view because that's the one the ACME server will be able to see. CAA Record Issues \u00b6 CAA is a relatively new type of DNS record that allows site owners to specify which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates containing their domain names. Let's Encrypt, being a well behaved CA, tries to validate CAA records before issuing a certificate for a domain. So if you have a CAA record that is not correctly set to to allow Let's Encrypt, your challenge validation would fail. But there are a number of reasons why it might fail even if you are not using CAA records in your zone.

This is the basic command that will query your local DNS server. But it's usually wise to specifically query a public DNS resolver like Google (8.8.8.8) or CloudFlare (1.1.1.1) in case you're in a split-brain DNS environment. However, some businesses are starting to deploy firewalls that block outbound DNS requests like this. So make sure you are able to query a known good record before tearing your hair out troubleshooting the record you're having trouble with. Here's how to explicitly query an external resolver.

Let's Encrypt Options \u00b6 To understand why Let's Encrypt is offering multiple trust chains and why you as a site/service operator would choose one or the other, it is helpful to read the following posts: DST Root CA X3 Expiration (September 2021) Extending Android Device Compatibility for Let's Encrypt Certificates Production Chain Changes Your default choice is currently the longer chain that builds to the expiring DST Root CA X3 3rd party certificate which should be compatible with almost all Android devices until 2024.

Ultimately, your choice should depend on the clients that are connecting to your service. But if you don't know, it's probably safest to just leave the default.

The first is that the DNS provider hosting the zone either doesn't have an API or the ACME client doesn't have a plugin to support it. The second is that for security reasons, the business may not want to save API credentials for their critical DNS zone on an internet-facing web server. The workaround for both of these involves using a CNAME record to redirect challenge requests to another DNS zone. When the ACME server goes to validate the challenges, it will follow the CNAME and check the challenge token from the redirected record. If the original problem was no API or no plugin, you'd put the redirected zone on a provider with an API and a supported plugin. If the original problem was security related, you'd make the redirected zone a less important one. The downside is the extra manual step required to add the CNAME for each new cert or name in a cert. But you only have to do that once ever for each name. Creating CNAMEs \u00b6 So how do we do that? First, you have to understand how the ACME protocol chooses what record to query for each name in a certificate. Non-wildcard names have _acme-challenge. prepended to them. Wildcard names use the same prefix but it replaces the *. prefix. So for example: Cert Name Challenge Record example.com _acme-challenge.example.com *.example.com _acme-challenge.example.com sub1.example.com _acme-challenge.sub1.example.com *.sub1.example.com _acme-challenge.sub1.example.com www.sub1.sub2.example.com _acme-challenge.www.sub1.sub2.example.com You may have noticed that a wildcard name and a non-wildcard for the same root domain have the same challenge record. That's not a mistake and the ACME server does actually expect to get two different values for the same TXT record. What it means for you though is that you only have one CNAME to create for both types of names. Where do you point the CNAMEs to? It doesn't really matter as long as the ACME server can query it from the Internet and Posh-ACME can create the necessary records there. Some choose to use the same _acme-challenge. prefix for clarity. Some use a different prefix because their provider doesn't allow names to start with a _ character. Some just point all of their CNAMEs to the exact same place. Examples: Challenge Record CNAME Target _acme-challenge.example.com _acme-challenge.example.net _acme-challenge.example.com acme.example.net _acme-challenge.example.com _acme-challenge.validation.example.net _acme-challenge.example.com _acme-challenge.sub1.example.com _acme-challenge.sub2.example.com acme.example.net _acme-challenge.example.com example.net Warning Don't point too many CNAMES at the same target.

If your record is too big, the validations will fail. Testing \u00b6 You should verify your CNAME was created correctly before you try and use it. If you're inside a business with a split-horizon DNS infrastructure, you might need to explicitly query a public external resolver like CloudFlare's 1.1.1.1.

It is useful when your actual DNS provider doesn't have a supported plugin or security policies/limitations in your environment don't allow you to use a supported plugin. Initial certificate generation requires some manual steps, but renewals can be automated just like other plugins. Setup \u00b6 While there is a publicly accessible acme-dns instance that you can use to test with at https://auth.acme-dns.io, it is not recommended for production use. Instead, you should run your own instance using the install instructions on the project page. Once you have your instance running, it needs to be accessible via HTTPS to your client and via standard DNS (port 53) to ACME servers on the Internet. Then, all you need is its hostname to use the plugin. Using the Plugin \u00b6 If your acme-dns instance is using the default configuration running with TLS on port 443, the only required parameter for the plugin is ACMEServer which is the hostname of your instance. If you are not using TLS, using an alternate port, or require additional uri path segments, you will need to specify the full URI using ACMEUri instead. There is also an optional ACMEAllowFrom parameter which takes an array of strings with networks specified in CIDR notation. If included, these networks will be the only ones that can send TXT record updates to the server for the registrations that get created as part of the certificate request. In some environments, it may make more sense to control network access via standard firewalls. This plugin is ultimately using CNAME aliases for DNS challenges under the hood. The first time you use it, you will be prompted to create the necessary CNAME records for each new name included in a cert. PS C:\\> New-PACertificate example . com -Plugin AcmeDns -PluginArgs @{ ACMEServer = 'auth.acme-dns.io' } Please create the following CNAME records: ------------------------------------------ _acme-challenge.example.com -> xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.auth.acme-dns.io ------------------------------------------ Press any key to continue.: For each CNAME in the list, you need to create the associated record on your DNS server before continuing. Assuming the records get created properly, the process should complete successfully. Future renewals will complete without additional prompting as long as no new names are added to the cert. (Advanced) Pre-registration and CNAME creation \u00b6 Some organizations may want to pre-create the acme-dns registrations and add the necessary CNAME records to their DNS infrastructure prior to working with Posh-ACME. In this case, you can avoid the first-run interactive prompts by passing the necessary registration object(s) in a hashtable using the ACMERegistration parameter. For example, a cert that contains example.com and www.example.com will have two acme-dns registrations created (one for each name). Each registration contains four values: subdomain, username, password, and full domain. Creating the registration objects and creating the certificate might look something like this: $reg = @{ '_acme-challenge.example.com' = @( # the array order of these values is important '9aa5ce59-635e-440c-b2ca-12ee3503ddee' # subdomain '1b5cce3b-255d-4ffb-a81f-a9e27167ac7a' # username 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' # password '9aa5ce59-635e-440c-b2ca-12ee3503ddee.acmedns.example.com' # full domain ) '_acme-challenge.www.example.com' = @( 'ec6ec1f4-836e-462e-b577-b2f4e04d7291' 'aeb00c77-852b-465e-9b27-984bc6cb12f5' 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy' 'ec6ec1f4-836e-462e-b577-b2f4e04d7291.acmedns.example.com' ) } $pArgs = @{ ACMEServer = 'acmedns.example.com' ACMERegistration = $reg } New-PACertificate example . com , www . example . com -Plugin AcmeDns -PluginArgs $pArgs","title":"AcmeDns"},{"location":"Plugins/AcmeDns/#how-to-use-the-acmedns-plugin","text":"This plugin works against acme-dns which is limited DNS server implementation designed specifically to handle DNS challenges for the ACME protocol.

It is assumed that you already have an active subscription with at least one DNS zone, associated Resource Group, and an account with access to create roles and app registrations. The setup commands used in this guide will also make use of the Az module. But it is not required to use the plugin normally. Setup \u00b6 This plugin has three distinct methods for authentication against Azure. The first involves specifying a Tenant ID and credentials for an account or app registration. The second requires an existing OAuth 2.0 access token which would generally be used for short lived services or environments where Azure authentication is being handled externally to the Posh-ACME module. The last is for systems running within Azure that have a Managed Service Identity (MSI) and utilizes the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) to request an access token. All methods require that the identity being used to authenticate has been given access to modify TXT records in the specified Azure subscription. If you have already done that, you can skip most of the following setup. Connect to Azure \u00b6 Using an account with access to create roles and app registrations, connect to Azure with the following commands. We'll be saving the resulting Subscription and Tenant ID values for later. # On Windows, this will pop up a web-GUI to login with. On other OSes, # it will ask you to open a browser separately with a code for logging in. $az = Connect-AzAccount # Save the subscription/tentant ID for later $subscriptionID = $az . Context . Subscription . Id $tenantID = $az . Context . Subscription . TenantId Create a Custom Role \u00b6 We're going to create a custom role that is limited to modifying TXT records in whatever resource group it is assigned to. It will be based on the default DNS Zone Contributor role. $roleDef = Get-AzRoleDefinition -Name \"DNS Zone Contributor\" $roleDef . Id = $null $roleDef . Name = \"DNS TXT Contributor\" $roleDef . Description = \"Manage DNS TXT records only.\" $roleDef . Actions . RemoveRange ( 0 , $roleDef . Actions . Count ) $roleDef . Actions . Add ( \"Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/TXT/*\" ) $roleDef .

Id ) \" ) $role = New-AzRoleDefinition $roleDef $role (Optional) Create a Service Principal / App Registration \u00b6 If you're using Posh-ACME from outside Azure and not using an existing access token, it is wise to create a dedicated service principal limited to modifying TXT records. Service Principals are tied to App Registrations in Azure AD and creating the former will automatically create the latter (though it's technically possible to create them separately). Service Principals are associated with one or more Credentials which can be password or certificated based. Certificates can be a bit trickier to setup particularly on non-Windows OSes, but Microsoft recommends them over passwords. We'll go over both methods below. Both also have configurable expiration values that default to 1 year and we'll be setting ours to 5 years, but you can choose whatever you like. $notBefore = Get-Date $notAfter = $notBefore . AddYears ( 5 ) Password Based Principal \u00b6 The New-AzADServicePrincipal function will generate a password for us, so all we have to do is give it a name and specify our expiration dates. We'll also use -SkipAssignment to prevent the default functionality of giving it the Contributor role on the subscription. $spParams = @{ DisplayName = 'PoshACME' StartDate = $notBefore EndDate = $notAfter SkipAssignment = $true } $sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal @spParams You'll use your new credential with either the AZAppCred plugin parameter or AZAppUsername and AZAppPasswordInsecure plugin parameters. The username is in the ApplicationId property and the password is in Secret . Here's how to save a reference to them for later. # For AZAppCred $appCred = [pscredential] :: new ( $sp . ApplicationId , $sp . Secret ) # For AZAppUsername and AZAppPasswordInsecure $appUser = $appCred . UserName $appPass = $appCred . GetNetworkCredential (). Password Certificate Based Principal on Windows \u00b6 Before we can create a certificate based credential, we have to actually create a certificate to use with it. Self-signed certs are fine here because we're only using them to sign data and Azure just needs to verify the signature using the public key we will associate with the principal. Note New-SelfSignedCertificate is only available on Windows 10/2016 or later. Check this document for instructions on earlier OSes.

Generate Consumer Key \u00b6 Now we need to generate a Consumer Key for these App credentials that is associated with a set of permissions on your account. There are generally three different ways to configure permissions for the Consumer Key. Write access to all DNS zones on your account. This is useful if you want a single instance of Posh-ACME to be able to generate certs for any name in any domain you might host on OVH. Write access to only a specific set of DNS zones on your account. This lets you keep some zones inaccessible, but still lets you generate certs for any name within allowed set of domains. Write access only to specific pre-created TXT records. This is the most complicated to setup, but also provides the least risk in case the key is compromised. There is a helper function built-into the plugin file that can make setting up these permissions easier. In order to use it, run the following to add the function to your current PowerShell session. Then follow the instructions in the next section for the option you will be using. Import-Module Posh-ACME . ( Join-Path ( Get-Module Posh-ACME ).

For non-wildcard names, prepend _acme-challenge. to the name. For wildcard names, replace the * with _acme-challenge . For a cert that contains example.com , www.example.com , and support.example.com , you would need to create the following three records. Sub-domain: _acme-challenge .example.com Sub-domain: _acme-challenge.www .example.com Sub-domain: _acme-challenge.support .example.com For a typical wildcard cert that contains example.com and *.example.com , you would need to create two copies of the same record. Sub-domain: _acme-challenge .example.com Sub-domain: _acme-challenge .example.com Once your records are created, you need to identify the record ID for each one. Unfortunately, we haven't found an easy way to find these from OVH's web based DNS editor. The closest alternative is the API Console . Login and expand the GET /domain/zone/{zoneName}/record entry.

It should contain a GET /domain/zone/<zone name>/record* and POST /domain/zone/<zone name>/refresh entry for each domain plus a PUT /domain/zone/<zone name>/record/<id> entry for each record. So the typical wildcard cert example might look like this: $rules = @( @{ method = 'GET' ; path = '/domain/zone/example.com/record*' } @{ method = 'POST' ; path = '/domain/zone/example.com/refresh' } @{ method = 'PUT' ; path = '/domain/zone/example.com/record/1111111111' } @{ method = 'PUT' ; path = '/domain/zone/example.com/record/2222222222' } ) Using the appropriate region code from the table above and the Application Key you previously created, run the following PowerShell and follow the instructions it gives.

It can also be in a folder outside the module and referenced using the POSHACME_PLUGINS environment variable. The file name is what users will use to reference it when specifying a plugin, so it should be related to the provider it is publishing against. All plugins must contain a function called Get-CurrentPluginType which returns a string indicating the type of ACME challenge they support. Posh-ACME currently supports the dns-01 and http-01 challenge types. DNS plugins must contain the following additional functions: Add-DnsTxt Remove-DnsTxt Save-DnsTxt HTTP plugins must contain the following additional functions: Add-HttpChallenge Remove-HttpChallenge Save-HttpChallenge The easiest way to get started is to make a copy of _Example-DNS.ps1 or _Example-HTTP.ps1 depending on the type of plugin you are making and rename it for your purposes. Pull Requests for new plugins are quite welcome. Function Details \u00b6 Add-DnsTxt and Remove-DnsTxt \u00b6 These are responsible for adding/removing TXT records to/from a DNS server/provider. There are two mandatory and positional string parameters, $RecordName and $TxtValue . RecordName is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the record we will be adding a TXT value for. TxtValue is the actual value that will be set in the TXT record. Do not modify or remove these first two parameters. Additional parameters should be added as necessary for the specific DNS provider such as credentials or API keys. In addition to standard PowerShell naming standards, their names must also not conflict with any other plugin's parameters. A good way to do that is to use a unique prefix on all of the parameters. It doesn't have to match the plugin name exactly as long as it's unique and reasonably related to the plugin. Common parameters that can be shared between this plugin's functions should be named the same as each other. The last parameter should always be $ExtraParams with the ValueFromRemainingArguments parameter attribute. This allows callers to splat the combined collection of plugin parameters to each plugin without errors for parameters that don't exist. Many DNS providers will only need the Add and Remove functions. In those cases, remember to remove all but the $ExtraParams parameter in the Save function and just leave the function body empty. For other providers, it is may be more efficient to stage changes in bulk and then perform what is effectively a Save or Commit operation on those changes. In those cases, implement the Save function as described below. Add-HttpChallenge and Remove-HttpChallenge \u00b6 These are responsible for publishing/unpublishing the ACME challenge body text at a specific HTTP URL. There are three mandatory and positional string parameters, $Domain , $Token , and $Body . Domain and Token are what the validation server will use to build the URL it will check against ( http://<Domain>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<Token> ). Body is the text value it expects to get in response to that query. Do not modify or remove these first three parameters. Additional parameters should be added as necessary for the specific HTTP provider such as filesystem paths, credentials, or API keys. In addition to standard PowerShell naming standards, their names must also not conflict with any other plugin's parameters. A good way to do that is to use a unique prefix on all of the parameters. It doesn't have to match the plugin name exactly as long as it's unique and reasonably related to the plugin. Common parameters that can be shared between this plugin's functions should be named the same as each other. The last parameter should always be $ExtraParams with the ValueFromRemainingArguments parameter attribute. This allows callers to splat the combined collection of plugin parameters to each plugin without errors for parameters that don't exist. Many HTTP providers will only need the Add and Remove functions. In those cases, remember to remove all but the $ExtraParams parameter in the Save function and just leave the function body empty. For other providers, it is may be more efficient to stage changes in bulk and then perform what is effectively a Save or Commit operation on those changes. In those cases, implement the Save function as described below. Save-DnsTxt and Save-HttpChallenge \u00b6 These functions are optional for DNS/HTTP plugins where it is more efficient to stage changes in bulk before Saving or Committing the changes. There are no required parameters except $ExtraParams which should always be last and have the ValueFromRemainingArguments parameter attribute. Parameter Types \u00b6 Try to limit parameters to simple data types like [string] , [int] , and [switch] . Arrays and Hashtables are fine as long as the contents are also simple types. Hashtables in particular should not be nested. The parameters should be able to convert nicely back and forth using Convert-ToJson and Convert-FromJson . Secrets such as passwords and API keys/tokens should use [SecureString] or [PSCredential] parameters even if you ultimately need them in plain text within the plugin. This ensures the values are encrypted when saved to disk for later renewals. Here are some examples for how to convert them back to plain text in the plugin code. # get the username and password from a PSCredential called $cred $username = $cred . Username $password = $cred . GetNetworkCredential (). Password # get the plain text from a SecureString called $secString $plainText = [pscredential] :: new ( 'a' , $secString ). GetNetworkCredential (). Password Usage Guides \u00b6 In addition to the native function help, it can be very helpful to new users to have a plugin specific readme. It should be a Markdown formatted file in the docs/Plugins folder called <PluginName>.md . It's usually easiest to copy an existing guide and modify it. For people who may be setting up automation against their provider for the first time, it can be helpful to add guidance on creating service accounts, limited access roles, or any prerequisite setup that the plugin requires to work properly. It should also have a section with an example on how to use the plugin with New-PACertificate . General Development Tips and Tricks \u00b6 No Write-Host \u00b6 Unless your plugin requires interactive user input which should be rare, do not use Write-Host to display informational messages or debug output. Use Write-Verbose for messages you would want a potential user to see. Use Write-Debug for things only the plugin developer would likely care about or a user trying to troubleshoot a plugin that is not working. When testing your module, use -Verbose to see your verbose messages. And run $DebugPreference = 'Continue' to make the debug messages show up without prompting for confirmation (which happens if you use -Debug ) . No Pipeline Output \u00b6 Do not output any objects to the pipeline from your plugin. This will interfere with scripts and workflows that use the normal output of public functions. You can use Out-Null on internal calls that would normally output to the pipeline when you don't care about that data. UseBasicParsing \u00b6 Any time you call Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-RestMethod , you should always add @script:UseBasic to the end. By default in PowerShell 5.1, those two functions use Internet Explorer's DOM parser to process the response body which can cause errors in cases where IE is not installed or hasn't gone through its first-run sequence yet. Both functions have a -UseBasicParsing parameter that switches the parser to a PowerShell native parser and is the new default functionality in PowerShell 6+. The parameter is also deprecated because they don't plan on bringing back IE DOM parsing in future PowerShell versions. So the module creates a variable when it is first loaded that checks whether -UseBasicParsing is still available or not and adds it to the $script:UseBasic hashtable. That way, you can just splat it on all your calls to those two functions which will future proof your plugin. Testing Plugins \u00b6 If the module is already loaded in the session, you will need to re-import it using Import-Module -Force . There is a helper script called instdev.ps1 in the root of the git repository that can make this process a lot easier as you are developing the plugin. First make sure any existing copies of the module are uninstalled (or at least don't reside in your $env:PSModulePath ). Clone the git repository (or your fork) to a folder on your local system and add your plugin file to the Posh-Acme\\Plugins folder if it's not already there. Open a new PowerShell session to the repository root folder and run .\\instdev.ps1 which will do the following: Copy the module files to the current user's default PowerShell modules folder. Run Import-Module Posh-ACME -Force Display the available module commands If there are no problems, your plugin should now be listed in the output of Get-PAPlugin . Testing a plugin can be done without requesting a new certificate. All you need is an existing ACME account created with New-PAAccount and the Publish-Challenge , Unpublish-Challenge , and Save-Challenge functions. They call the Add, Remove, and Save functions from the plugin. Here are some examples of how I generally call them while testing. $DebugPreference = 'Continue' $pArgs = @{ MyParam1 = 'asdf' ; MyParam2 = 'qwer' } # multiple calls to publish/unpublish are generally more useful for DNS plugins Publish-Challenge example . com ( Get-PAAccount ) test1 MyPlugin $pArgs -Verbose Publish-Challenge example . com ( Get-PAAccount ) test2 MyPlugin $pArgs -Verbose Publish-Challenge example . com ( Get-PAAccount ) test3 MyPlugin $pArgs -Verbose # save is only necessary if your plugin implements it Save-Challenge MyPlugin $pArgs -Verbose Unpublish-Challenge example . com ( Get-PAAccount ) test1 MyPlugin $pArgs -Verbose Unpublish-Challenge example . com ( Get-PAAccount ) test2 MyPlugin $pArgs -Verbose Unpublish-Challenge example . com ( Get-PAAccount ) test3 MyPlugin $pArgs -Verbose # save is only necessary if your plugin implements it Save-Challenge MyPlugin $pArgs -Verbose Alternatively, you can dot source the plugin file and call the functions directly. But this can be difficult if the functions depend on module-scoped variables like $script:UseBasic or internal module functions. Also, remember to dot source again each time you make a change to the plugin. DNS Specific Tips and Tricks \u00b6 Multiple TXT Values Per Record \u00b6 It is both supported and expected that a given TXT record may have multiple values. It's most common with wildcard certificates that contain both the wildcard name ( *.example.com ) and the root domain ( example.com ). Both names require TXT records be added for the same FQDN ( _acme-challenge.example.com ). This can also happen if the user is using CNAME challenge aliases. The Add/Remove functions need to support all potential states of the particular TXT record. But how the record is represented by a given provider seems to vary. Some represent it as a single record with multiple values that you need to add to or remove from. Others have distinct records for each value that can be created/deleted individually. So make sure you can both create a new record that doesn't exist and add a value to a record that already does. Remove Only Specific TxtValue \u00b6 Related to having multiple TXT values per record, the remove function must not blindly delete any record that matches $RecordName . It should be able to remove only the $TxtValue on a record that may have multiple values. But if the record only contains a single value, the record should be deleted entirely. Zone Matching \u00b6 A particular DNS provider may be hosting both domain apex zones ( example.com ) and sub-zones ( sub1.example.com ). One of the first things a plugin usually has to do is figure out which zone $RecordName needs to be added to. This should be the deepest sub-zone that would still contain $RecordName . Here are some examples assuming only the two previously mentioned zones exist. $RecordName Matching Zone _acme-challenge.example.com example.com _acme-challenge.site1.example.com example.com _acme-challenge.sub1.example.com sub1.example.com _acme-challenge.site1.sub1.example.com sub1.example.com _acme-challenge.site1.sub3.sub2.sub1.example.com sub1.example.com Many of the existing plugins have a helper function to handle this. Copy and modify their code where it makes sense but make sure helper function names are unique. DNS Aliases and Domain Apex \u00b6 Don't forget to test your functions against the domain apex which can happen when users are using DNS challenge aliases. There's often a special way to represent records in the domain apex from an API perspective, commonly with the @ character or an empty string instead of a record short name. # The my.cname.tld record doesn't actually need to exist for the test to work. # The plugin will only be writing to example.com Publish-Challenge my . cname . tld ( Get-PAAccount ) test1 MyPlugin $pArgs -DnsAlias example . com -Verbose Unpublish-Challenge my . cname . tld ( Get-PAAccount ) test1 MyPlugin $pArgs -DnsAlias example . com -Verbose Deriving Object IDs \u00b6 Many providers assign ID values to object types like zones and records that you need to use to manipulate those objects. A user should ideally not have to know or provide any zone, record, or object IDs in order to use the plugin. All of that should be discovered by the plugin code and the only thing the user should need to provide is whatever credentials or tokens the API requires for authentication. In the rare cases that you do need the user to provide something like a zone ID, make sure you allow for multiple values. A single certificate can contain names from many different zones and the plugin parameters that get passed to the plugin are the same for each TXT record that needs to be created. Trailing Dots \u00b6 Be aware how your particular DNS provider represents zone and record names. Some include the trailing dot ( example.com. ). Others don't. This can affect string matching when finding zones and existing records. Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) \u00b6 Many DNS providers and registrars support IDN domains which contain non-ascii unicode characters (or even emojis). When using IDN domains with ACME, the IDN names must be specified as Punycode . But the DNS providers may still send or receive the unicode version of the name. Particularly if your provider is not US-based, be aware of and try to account for how the provider handles IDN names. The .NET System.Globalization.IdnMapping class can help convert back and for between IDN and punycode names like this: # create an instance of the class $idn = [System.Globalization.IdnMapping] :: new () # convert an IDN name to punycode $idn . GetAscii ( 'b\u00fccher.example' ) # convert a punycode name back to IDN $idn . GetUnicode ( 'xn--bcher-kva.example' ) HTTP Specific Tips and Tricks \u00b6 Validation Timing \u00b6 When DNS plugins are used, there's a user customizable sleep timer between when the TXT records are published and the module asks the ACME server to validate those records because records are not typically available instantaneously worldwide. However, that sleep timer does not exist when an order is only using HTTP plugins because HTTP resources are typically available instantly. If your particular HTTP provider requires a delay between when the challenges are published and when they are validated, you should add that delay in the Save-HttpChallenge function of your plugin. Migrating DNS Plugins from 3.x to 4.x \u00b6 In case you have been using your own private DNS plugin in 3.x, here's how to migrate it to the 4.x format. Add function Get-CurrentPluginType { 'dns-01' } to the top of the file. Replace instances of Add-DnsTxt<Name> with Add-DnsTxt Replace instances of Remove-DnsTxt<Name> with Remove-DnsTxt Replace instances of Save-DnsTxt<Name> with Save-DnsTxt Replace instances of -DnsPlugin with -Plugin in usage guides.","title":"Plugin Development Guide"},{"location":"Plugins/Plugin-Development-Guide/#plugin-development-guide","text":"","title":"Plugin Development Guide"},{"location":"Plugins/Plugin-Development-Guide/#introduction","text":"A validation plugin for Posh-ACME is a standard PowerShell PS1 script file located in the module's Plugins folder.

It is assumed that you already have an AWS account with at least one DNS zone. The setup portion of this guide also assumes you have access to create IAM users/roles. If you have been given access credentials by your AWS admin, you may need the admin to create the IAM policies necessary for you to edit the zone TXT records. Note You may use this plugin without the AWS PowerShell module installed unless you use the profile name authentication method. In that case, you will either need the Aws.Tools.Route53 or the older AWSPowerShell or AWSPowerShell.NetCore module depending on your environment. More details can be found in the AWS PowerShell documentation . Setup \u00b6 There are generally two different ways to use this plugin depending on whether you are running it from outside AWS or inside from something like an EC2 instance. When outside, you need to specify explicit credentials for an IAM account that has permissions to modify a zone. When inside, you may instead choose to authenticate using an IAM Role . When using explicit credentials, a personal high-level account will work, but it's a better idea to create a dedicated user with the minimum necessary privileges to create the TXT records necessary for ACME challenges. If you already have your policies, users, groups, and roles setup, skip the rest of this section. Otherwise, read on for examples. Note These examples require either the AWS.Tools.IdentityManagement module or the older AWSPowerShell or AWSPowerShell.NetCore module depending on your environment. Setup Admin Credentials \u00b6 You'll need to create an Access key and associated secret for your account to use with the AWS module. Once you have those, use the following commands to save them to a local profile and set it as the default credential. If you have previously configured your AWS credentials into a profile via Set-AWSCredentials , skip that command below and replace references to the profile name in the Initialize-AWSDefaultConfiguration command with your own. Set-AWSCredential -StoreAs 'dnsadmin' -AccessKey 'xxxxxxxx' -SecretKey 'xxxxxxxx' Initialize-AWSDefaultConfiguration -ProfileName 'dnsadmin' Create IAM Policy \u00b6 Create the policy that allows modifications to hosted zones. $policyDef = @{ Version = '2012-10-17' ; Statement =@( @{ Effect = 'Allow' ; Action =@( 'route53:ListHostedZones' ); Resource = '*' ; }, @{ Effect = 'Allow' ; Action =@( 'route53:GetHostedZone' , 'route53:ListResourceRecordSets' , 'route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets' ); Resource = 'arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/*' ; } ) } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 ; $policyDef $policy = New-IAMPolicy \"R53_Zone_Editor\" -PolicyDocument $policyDef -Description \"Allow write access to hosted zones.\" If Using Explicit Credentials \u00b6 Create IAM Group and Associate to Policy \u00b6 Rather than associating the policy to a service account directly, it is wise to associate it to a group instead. That way you can easily add or replace additional users later as necessary. $group = New-IAMGroup -GroupName 'HostedZoneEditors' Register-IAMGroupPolicy $group . GroupName $policy . Arn Create IAM User and Add to Group \u00b6 Finally, we'll create the service account and add it to the group we created. We'll also create the access key to use with the plugin. $user = New-IAMUser -UserName 'posh-acme' Add-IAMUserToGroup $group . GroupName $user . UserName $key = New-IAMAccessKey $user . UserName $key The $key variable output should contains AccessKeyId and SecretAccessKey which are what you ultimately use with the plugin. If Using IAM Role \u00b6 Create IAM Role and Associate to Policy \u00b6 If your server that is using Posh-ACME lives within AWS (such as an EC2 instance), you can create an IAM Role and associate it to the instance which then avoids the need to use and store explicit credential for Route53. Here's how you might create the role and associate it with the policy created earlier. $roleTrust = @{ Version = '2012-10-17' Statement =@( @{ Effect = 'Allow' Action = 'sts:AssumeRole' Principal =@{ Service = 'ec2.amazonaws.com' } } ) } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 ; $roleTrust $role = New-IAMRole -RoleName 'R53_Zone_Editor_Role' -AssumeRolePolicyDocument $roleTrust -Description 'Allows associated EC2 instances to modify Route53 zones for certificate validation purposes.' Register-IAMRolePolicy $role . RoleName $policy . Arn Now you'd need to attach the role with your EC2 instance or launch a new instance with the role pre-attached. More details on that can be found here . Using the Plugin \u00b6 If you are using explicit credentials, you may send them directly to the plugin via R53AccessKey and R53SecretKey parameters.

The plugin will not automatically stop and restart the other web server. Setup \u00b6 Windows Only Prerequisites \u00b6 When running on Windows, the HttpListener class depends on a kernel mode web server called http.sys.

The easiest thing to do is create the reservation and give permissions to \"Everyone\". It's perfectly reasonable to only grant permissions to the user or group who will need it as well.

So if you're using an alternate port, make sure there's an appropriate port forward if it's behind NAT or an HTTP redirect if another server is in front of it. Additional Considerations \u00b6 Regardless of the underlying OS, you need to make sure the listener won't conflict with other software running on the system. If port 80 is in use, you will need to run the listener on an alternate port. But keep in mind, the ACME challenge validations must be served from port 80 on the internet-facing side of things.

It doesn't matter whether it's hosted on-premises or in the cloud, physical or virtual, domain joined or standalone. As long as it can be managed via the standard DnsServer PowerShell module , it should be supported. This does not work against Azure DNS . Use the Azure plugin for that. Warning The DnsServer module is not available on Windows versions prior to Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. So this plugin will only work on those OSes or newer. Using Zone Scopes requires the Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 version of the module or newer. Warning This plugin currently does not work on non-Windows OSes in PowerShell Core. On Windows, it requires at least PowerShell 7. Setup \u00b6 DnsServer module \u00b6 The client machine running Posh-ACME must have the DnsServer PowerShell module installed. On Windows Server OSes, this can be installed from Server Manager or via PowerShell as follows. Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-DNS-Server On Windows client OSes, you will need to download and install the appropriate Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) for your OS. The installers are historically OS specific. Here are links for Windows 10 , Windows 8.1 , Windows 8 , and Windows 7 . Warning The vast majority of testing for this plugin was done on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. Please submit issues if you run into problems on downlevel OSes. PSRemoting and New-CimSession \u00b6 The DnsServer module relies on PowerShell remoting via New-CimSession to establish a remote connection to the DNS server. Depending on your environment, PSRemoting might already be enabled. If not, you need to make sure it is working between your client and DNS server before trying to use Posh-ACME. Typically, the easiest environment to get things working has both client and server domain joined to the same Active Directory or different domains where the client's domain credentials are trusted by the server's AD. In this case, you can try the following to test from the client machine. # test in the context of the current process (current user) $cs = New-CimSession -ComputerName dnsserver . example . com # test in the context of a different user $cs = New-CimSession -ComputerName dnsserver . example . com -Credential ( Get-Credential ) In environments where one or both of the client and server are not domain joined, you may need to explicitly connect via HTTPS. This may involve extra steps during setup to enable an HTTPS listener on the server. Here is a decent guide on getting things setup with a self-signed certificate, though a trusted certificate would work as well. And here is how to test from the client machine. $so = New-CimSessionOption -UseSsl $cs = New-CimSession -ComputerName dnsserver . example . com -Credential ( Get-Credential ) -SessionOptions $so Do not proceed until you can successfully establish a CimSession from the client to the DNS server. Permissions \u00b6 Setting permissions on Windows DNS depends on whether the DNS zones are integrated with Active Directory or not. Standalone non-domain joined DNS servers don't really have granular permissions as far as I can tell. The user must be local administrator. AD integrated servers can usually set more granular permissions on a per-zone level or better. Suffice it to say, the account being used to connect must have adequate permissions to add and delete TXT records in the associated zone(s). Using the Plugin \u00b6 In a domain joined environment, the only required parameter is the hostname or IP of the DNS server unless you want the module to use different credentials than what PowerShell is running as. In that case, you would specify credentials and optionally the -WinUseSSL switch. Both of those tend to be required for non-domain joined servers. # domain joined environment, no credentials or SSL needed New-PACertificate example . com -Plugin Windows -PluginArgs @{ WinServer = 'dns1.example.com' } # standalone environment, adding credentials and SSL flag $pArgs = @{ WinServer = 'dns1.example.com' WinCred = ( Get-Credential ) WinUseSSL = $true } New-PACertificate example . com -Plugin Windows -PluginArgs $pArgs Advanced Features \u00b6 Zone Scopes were added in the Windows Server 2016 version of the DNS server and are now supported in the plugin with the WinZoneScope parameter. This is useful if you have a split-brain DNS setup and your external zone is in the non-default scope. Using the parameter requires that your client be running the Windows 10/2016 version of the DnsServer module. # using zone scope in domain joined environment $pArgs = @{ WinServer = 'dns1.example.com' WinZoneScope = 'external' } New-PACertificate example . com -Plugin Windows -PluginArgs $pArgs VirtualizationInstances are not currently supported.

Depending on your environment, PSRemoting might already be enabled. If not, you need to make sure it is working between your client and DNS server before trying to use Posh-ACME. Typically, the easiest environment to get things working has both client and server domain joined to the same Active Directory or different domains where the client's domain credentials are trusted by the server's AD. In this case, you can try the following to test from the client machine. # test in the context of the current process (current user) $cs = New-CimSession -ComputerName dnsserver . example . com # test in the context of a different user $cs = New-CimSession -ComputerName dnsserver . example . com -Credential ( Get-Credential ) In environments where one or both of the client and server are not domain joined, you may need to explicitly connect via HTTPS. This may involve extra steps during setup to enable an HTTPS listener on the server. Here is a decent guide on getting things setup with a self-signed certificate, though a trusted certificate would work as well. And here is how to test from the client machine. $so = New-CimSessionOption -UseSsl $cs = New-CimSession -ComputerName dnsserver . example . com -Credential ( Get-Credential ) -SessionOptions $so Do not proceed until you can successfully establish a CimSession from the client to the DNS server.","title":"PSRemoting and New-CimSession"},{"location":"Plugins/Windows/#permissions","text":"Setting permissions on Windows DNS depends on whether the DNS zones are integrated with Active Directory or not.
