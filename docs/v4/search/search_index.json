So let's clarify first. An order is a request for a certificate that contains one or more \"identifiers\" (a name like <code>example.com</code>). Each identifier in an order has an authorization object associated with it that indicates whether the account that created the order is authorized to get a cert for that name. New authorizations start in a pending state awaiting the client to complete a challenge associated with that authorization. Each authorization can have multiple different challenges (DNS, HTTP, ALPN, etc) that indicate the different methods the ACME server will accept to prove ownership of the name. You only need to complete one of the offered challenges in order to satisfy an authorization.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Different types of identifiers may only allow a subset of challenge types. For instance, wildcard DNS names can only be validated by a DNS challenge and IP addresses can only be validated by HTTP or ALPN challenges.</p> <p><code>Get-PAAuthorization</code> can be used with the output of <code>Get-PAOrder</code> to retrieve the current set of authorizations (and their challenges) for an order. So lets put those details into a variable and display them.</p> <pre><code>$auths = Get-PAOrder | Get-PAAuthorization\n$auths\n</code></pre> <p>This should give an output that looks something like this.

Normally the challenge specific details are buried a bit deeper in a <code>challenges</code> property, but Posh-ACME tries to help by surfacing the commonly used challenge details on the root object.

The ACME validation server is smart enough to check all of the returned results and find the one it cares about.</p> <p>Now it's up to you to publish the record on your DNS server that is queryable from the Internet. Depending on your DNS provider and its replication topology, it may take anywhere from seconds to minutes for the records you create to be queryable from the Internet.

This can be useful if your primary DNS server has no API or the security posture of your organization doesn't allow an automated process such as an ACME client to have write access to the zone you need to create TXT records within. If you know this will be the case, you can create a permanent CNAME record for the <code>_acme-challenge.&lt;FQDN&gt;</code> name that points to another FQDN somewhere else.

So for example:</p> Cert Name Challenge Record example.com _acme-challenge.example.com *.example.com _acme-challenge.example.com sub1.example.com _acme-challenge.sub1.example.com *.sub1.example.com _acme-challenge.sub1.example.com www.sub1.sub2.example.com _acme-challenge.www.sub1.sub2.example.com <p>You may have noticed that a wildcard name and a non-wildcard for the same root domain have the same challenge record. That's not a mistake and the ACME server does actually expect to get two different values for the same TXT record. What it means for you though is that you only have one CNAME to create for both types of names.</p> <p>Where do you point the CNAMEs to? It doesn't really matter as long as the ACME server can query it from the Internet and Posh-ACME can create the necessary records there. Some choose to use the same <code>_acme-challenge.</code> prefix for clarity. Some use a different prefix because their provider doesn't allow names to start with a <code>_</code> character. Some just point all of their CNAMEs to the exact same place.

More on that later.</p> <p>The first thing to do is figure out which DNS plugin to use and how to use it. Start by listing the available plugins.</p> <pre><code>Get-PAPlugin\n</code></pre> <p>Most plugins have a detailed usage guide here. In these examples, we'll use the AWS Route53 plugin. Here's a quick shortcut to get to the usage guide. This will open the default browser to the page on Windows and just display the URL on non-Windows.</p> <pre><code>Get-PAPlugin Route53 -Guide\n</code></pre> <p>Using a plugin will almost always require creating a hashtable with required plugin parameters. To see a quick reference of the available parameter sets try this:</p> <pre><code>PS&gt; Get-PAPlugin Route53 -Params\n\n    Set Name: Keys (Default)\n\nParameter    Type         IsMandatory\n---------    ----         -----------\nR53AccessKey String       True\nR53SecretKey SecureString True\n\n    Set Name: KeysInsecure\n\nParameter            Type   IsMandatory\n---------            ----   -----------\nR53AccessKey         String True\nR53SecretKeyInsecure String True\n\n    Set Name: Profile\n\nParameter      Type   IsMandatory\n---------      ----   -----------\nR53ProfileName String True\n\n    Set Name: IAMRole\n\nParameter     Type            IsMandatory\n---------     ----            -----------\nR53UseIAMRole SwitchParameter True\n</code></pre> <p>We can see there are four different parameter sets we can use: <code>Keys</code>, <code>KeysInsecure</code>, <code>Profile</code>, and <code>IAMRole</code>. The <code>Keys</code> set requires <code>R53AccessKey</code> and <code>R53SecretKey</code>. These are API credentials for AWS and presumably as an AWS user, you already know how to generate them. The access key is just a normal String variable. But the secret key is a <code>SecureString</code> which takes a bit more effort to setup. So let's create the hashtable we need.</p> <pre><code>$r53Secret = Read-Host 'Enter Secret' -AsSecureString\n$pArgs = @{R53AccessKey='ABCD1234'; R53SecretKey=$r53Secret}\n</code></pre> <p>This <code>$pArgs</code> variable is what we'll pass to the <code>-PluginArgs</code> parameter on functions that use it.</p> <p>Now we know what plugin we're using and we have our plugin arguments in a hashtable. If this is the first time using a particular plugin, it's usually wise to test it before actually trying to use it for a new certificate. So let's do that. The command has no output unless we add the <code>-Verbose</code> switch to show what's going on under the hood.</p> <pre><code># get a reference to the current account\n$acct = Get-PAAccount\n\nPublish-Challenge example.com -Account $acct -Token faketoken -Plugin Route53 -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose\n</code></pre> <p>Assuming there was no error, you should be able to validate that the TXT record was created in the Route53 management console. If so, go ahead and unpublish the record. Otherwise, troubleshoot why it failed and get it working before moving on.</p> <pre><code>Unpublish-Challenge example.com -Account $acct -Token faketoken -Plugin Route53 -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose\n</code></pre> <p>All we have left to do is add the necessary plugin parameters to our original certificate request command. But let's get crazy and change it up a bit by making the cert a wildcard cert with the root domain as a subject alternative name (SAN).</p> <pre><code>New-PACertificate '*.example.com','example.com' -AcceptTOS -Contact 'admin@example.com' -Plugin Route53 `\n    -PluginArgs $pArgs -Verbose\n</code></pre> <p>Warning</p> <p>According to current Let's Encrypt rate limits, a single certificate can have up to 100 names. The only caveat is that wildcard certs may not contain any SANs that would overlap with the wildcard entry. So you'll get an error if you try to put <code>*.example.com</code> and <code>www.example.com</code> in the same cert. But <code>*.example.com</code> and <code>example.com</code> or <code>www.sub.example.com</code> are just fine.</p> <p>We included the <code>-Verbose</code> switch again so we can see what's going on. But normally, that wouldn't be necessary. Assuming everything went well, you should now have a fresh new wildcard cert that required no user interaction. Keep in mind, HTTP plugins work the exactly the same way as DNS plugins. They just can't be used to validate wildcard names in certs from Let's Encrypt.</p>"},{"location":"Tutorial/#renewals-and-deployment","title":"Renewals and Deployment","text":"<p>Now that you have a cert order that can successfully answer DNS challenges via a plugin, it's even easier to renew it.</p> <pre><code>Submit-Renewal\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Be aware that renewals don\u2019t count against your Certificates per Registered Domain limit, but they are subject to a Duplicate Certificate limit of 5 per week.</p> <p>The module saves all of the parameters associated with an order and re-uses the same values to renew it. It will throw a warning right now because the cert hasn't reached the suggested renewal window. But you can use <code>-Force</code> to do it anyway if you want to try it. Let's Encrypt currently caches authorizations for roughly 30 days, so the forced renewal won't need to go through validating the challenges again.

So you'll likely want to create a script to both renew the cert and deploy it to your service/application. All the details you should need to deploy the cert are in the PACertificate object that is returned by <code>Submit-Renewal</code>. It's also the same object returned by <code>New-PACertificate</code> and <code>Get-PACertificate</code>; the latter being useful to test deployment scripts with.</p> <p><code>Submit-Renewal</code> will only return PACertificate objects for certs that were actually renewed successfully.
