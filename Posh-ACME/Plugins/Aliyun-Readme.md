# How To Use the Aliyun (Alibaba Cloud) DNS Plugin

This plugin works against the [Aliyun (Alibaba Cloud)](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/dns) DNS provider. It is assumed that you have already setup an account and registered the domains or zones you will be working against.

## Setup

First, login to your account and go to the [Security Management](https://usercenter.console.aliyun.com/#/manage/ak) page. Click the `Create Access Key` link and make a note of the Key ID and Secret values.

**Note:** It is also supported recommended to use RAM (Resource Access Management) users with more limited privileges instead of your root account key. More information about creating RAM users can be found [here](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/product/28625.htm).

## Using the Plugin

The Key ID is specified as a string using `AliKeyId` and the secret is specified as a SecureString using `AliSecret`.

*NOTE: The `AliSecretInsecure` parameter is still supported but should be considered deprecated and may be removed in a future major release.*

```powershell
$secret = Read-Host "Secret" -AsSecureString
$pArgs = @{
    AliKeyId = 'asdf1234'
    AliSecret = $secret
}
New-PACertificate example.com -Plugin Aliyun -PluginArgs $pArgs
```
