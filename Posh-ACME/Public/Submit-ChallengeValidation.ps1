    .SYNOPSIS
        Respond to authorization challenges for an ACME order and wait for the ACME server to validate them.

    .DESCRIPTION
        An ACME order contains an authorization object for each domain in the order. The client must complete at least one of a set of challenges for each authorization in order to prove they own the domain. Once complete, the client asks the server to validate each challenge and waits for the server to do so and update the authorization status.

    .PARAMETER DnsPlugin
        One or more DNS plugin names to use for this order's DNS challenges. If no plugin is specified, the "Manual" plugin will be used. If the same plugin is used for all domains in the order, you can just specify it once. Otherwise, you should specify as many plugin names as there are domains in the order and in the same sequence as the ACME order.

    .PARAMETER PluginArgs
        A hashtable containing the plugin arguments to use with the specified DnsPlugin list. So if a plugin has a -MyText string and -MyNumber integer parameter, you could specify them as @{MyText='text';MyNumber=1234}.

        These arguments are saved to the current ACME account so they can be used automatically for subsequent certificates and renewals. New values will overwrite saved values for existing parameters.

    .PARAMETER DnsAlias
        One or more FQDNs that DNS challenges should be published to instead of the certificate domain's zone. This is used in advanced setups where a CNAME in the certificate domain's zone has been pre-created to point to the alias's FQDN which makes the ACME server check the alias domain when validation challenge TXT records. If the same alias is used for all domains in the order, you can just specify it once. Otherwise, you should specify as many alias FQDNs as there are domains in the order and in the same sequence as the order.

    .PARAMETER DnsSleep
        Number of seconds to wait for DNS changes to propagate before asking the ACME server to validate DNS challenges. Default is 120.

    .PARAMETER ValidationTimeout
        Number of seconds to wait for the ACME server to validate the challenges after asking it to do so. Default is 60. If the timeout is exceeded, an error will be thrown.

    .PARAMETER Account
        If specified, switch to and use this account for the validations. It must be associated with the current server or an error will be thrown.

    .PARAMETER Order
        If specified, switch to and use this order for the validations. It must be associated with the current or specified account or an error will be thrown.

    .EXAMPLE
        Submit-ChallengeValidation

        Invoke manual DNS challenge validation on the currently selected account and order.

    .EXAMPLE
        $pluginArgs = @{FBServer='fb.example.com'; FBCred=(Get-Credential)}
        PS C:\>Submit-ChallengeValidation Flurbog $pluginArgs

        Invoke DNS challenge validation using the hypothetical Flurbog plugin on the currently selected account and order.

    .EXAMPLE
        $pluginArgs = @{FBServer='fb.example.com'; FBCred=(Get-Credential)}
        PS C:\>Submit-ChallengeValidation Flurbog $pluginArgs -DnsAlias validate.alt-example.com

        This is the same as the previous example except that it's telling the Flurbog plugin to write to an alias domain. This only works if you have already created a CNAME record for the domain(s) in the order that points to validate.alt-example.com.

    .EXAMPLE
        $order = Get-PAOrder site1.example.com
        PS C:\>Submit-ChallengeValidation -Order $order

        Invoke manual DNS challenge validation on the specified order and currently selected account.
