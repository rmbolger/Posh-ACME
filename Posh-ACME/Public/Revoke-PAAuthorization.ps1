    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Revoke the authorization associated with an ACME identifier.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Many ACME server implementations cache succesful authorizations for a certain amount of time to avoid requiring an account to re-authorize identifiers for additional orders submitted during the cache window.

        This can make testing authorization challenges in a client more cumbersome by having to create new orders with uncached identifiers. This function allows you to revoke those cached authorizations so that subsequent orders will go through the full challenge validation process.

    .PARAMETER AuthURLs
        One or more authorization URLs. You also pipe in one or more PoshACME.PAOrder objects.

    .PARAMETER Account
        An existing ACME account object such as the output from Get-PAAccount. If no account is specified, the current account will be used.

    .PARAMETER Force
        If specified, no confirmation prompts will be presented.

    .EXAMPLE
        Revoke-PAAuthorization https://acme.example.com/authz/1234567

        Revoke the authorization for the specified URL using the current account.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-PAOrder | Revoke-PAAuthorization -Force

        Revoke all authorizations for the current order on the current account without confirmation prompts.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-PAOrder -List | Revoke-PAAuthorizations

        Revoke all authorizations for all orders on the current account.
