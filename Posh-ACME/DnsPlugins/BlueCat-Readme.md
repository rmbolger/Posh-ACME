# How To Use the BlueCat DNS Plugin

This plugin works against the [BlueCat Address Manager](https://www.bluecatnetworks.com/platform/management/bluecat-address-manager/) DNS provider. It is assumed that you have already have an account that is an "API User" and have created the DNS zone(s) you will be working against. This plugin has been tested against version 8.1.1.

## Using the Plugin

Due to the potentially short lifetime of a BAM auth token you must pass a username and password using the keys `BlueCatUsername` and `BlueCatPassword` along with the API uri as `BlueCatUri`. In addition you must also pass the Configuration name as `BlueCatConfig`, the DNS View name as `BlueCatView`, and the list of DNS servers to deploy as `BlueCatDeployTargets`.

```powershell
$BlueCatParams = @{
    BlueCatUsername='xxxxxxxx'
    BlueCatPassword='xxxxxxxx'
    BlueCatUri='https://FQDN//Services/API'
    BlueCatConfig='foobar'
    BlueCatView='foobaz'
    BlueCatDeployTargets=@('FQDN1', 'FQDN2', 'FQDN3')
}
