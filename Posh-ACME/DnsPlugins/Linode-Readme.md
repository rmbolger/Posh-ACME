# How To Use the Linode DNS Plugin

This plugin works against the [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=4dfd67cf6f1e384ce626f2943620186344bb2ccf) DNS provider. It is assumed that you have already setup an account and created the DNS zone(s) you will be working against.

## Setup

This plugin works against v4 of the Linode API which is not compatible with "legacy" pre-paid accounts. In order to use it and generate the appropriate API Token, your account must be a newer style "hourly billed" account which it should automatically be if you created it after late 2014.

Login to your account and go to the [API Tokens](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens) section of your profile. Generate a Personal Access Token and give it Read/Write access to Domains. Record the value to use later. You can't retrieve it if you forget it. You can only delete and re-create.

## Using the Plugin

The only required plugin parameter is `LItoken` which you need to configure as a secure string value. However, Linode has an unusually long delay between when a record is set and when it propagates to their public name servers. There's a note at the bottom of the DNS Manager web GUI that reads, "Changes made to a master zone will take effect in our nameservers every quarter hour." So you need to set `DnsSleep` parameter in `New-PACertificate` to at least 15 minutes. But in testing, 17 minutes (1020 seconds) seemed to be the minimum to reliably satisfy the challenges.

```powershell
$token = Read-Host "Token" -AsSecureString
New-PACertificate test.example.com -DnsPlugin Linode -PluginArgs @{LIToken=$token} -DnsSleep 1020
```
